### What is it ?

Hyde is a realtime markdown editor built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Currently in beta but is stable enough to use, so feel free to take it for a spin.

#### Roadmap:

- [x] Code highlighting and formatting
- [ ] Settings for highlighting theme (Editor + Preview)
- [ ] Toggle for GFM
- [ ] Settings for font style (serif/sans-serif) / font size
- [ ] Formatting buttons
- [x] Look into adding support for github features like checkboxes.
- [ ] Export options for HTML/PDF
- [ ] Support for brew cask installation


### Where can i get it ?
Installers for all platforms can be found [here](https://github.com/hparton/hyde/releases). This has not been tested on any platform other than OSX. If you run into any problems, please post an issue and i'll take a look at it.


### Development

The build tools are pretty much just [electron-boilerplate-vue](https://github.com/bradstewart/electron-boilerplate-vue) by [bradstewart](https://github.com/bradstewart/). This will be overhauled at some point to make it a bit leaner.
